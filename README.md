# cryptoUX
Repository for improving user experience for crypto - primarily focusing on private key management and onboarding

## Private Key Management
Some projects which are working in the same space:
* [Gnosis Safe](https://safe.gnosis.io)
* [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.org/) - Itâ€™s an open-source project that enables desktop Dapps to interact with mobile Wallets.
* Shamir's Secret - Sharded private keys with friends which enables authentication only when n-out of-m  keys are available

### Alternative Mechanisms
* [Project at ETHBerlin](https://devpost.com/software/ethstonia-identity) - Using private key enabled Govt ID (Estonia Govt ID) for login?   
* [Proposal](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/1078) by Alex van de Sande - Login with ENS subdomains
* [Tenzorum](https://tenzorum.org/) - Key Management protocol for decentralised web

### Software Wallets
* [MyCrypto](https://mycrypto.com/) - Web and Desktop based wallet App
* [TrustWallet](https://github.com/TrustWallet)
* [Edge](https://edge.app/) - Android/iOS based wallet
* [Parity Signer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nativesigner&hl=en_IN) - Still unreleased. App last updated on July 2017
  [Github Repo](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-signer) - In active development

### Hardware wallets
* Paper wallets
* Crypto Steel
* Trezor/Ledger Nano

Can U2F keys be used as crypto private key hardware wallets? What are the security issues involved?
