## Private Key Management
Some projects which are working in the same space:
* [Gnosis Safe](https://safe.gnosis.io)
* [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.org/) - Itâ€™s an open-source project that enables desktop Dapps to interact with mobile Wallets.
* Shamir's Secret - Sharded private keys with friends which enables authentication only when n-out of-m  keys are available
